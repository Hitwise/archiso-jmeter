Archiso-Jmeter! 
===============

A JMeter Engine Live Distribution.

What is it
----------

This boots up from a CD or USB key and requests a IP via DHCP.
After that, it sets its hostname from the ip address, and runs
a JMeter server instance in a tmux window.

JMeter is exposed as a Avahi service, and should be
discoverable by machines on the same subnet.

SSH is enabled, and the username is liveuser, password is password. You can change the password by modifying:
	
	config/releng/root-image/etc/rc.local

Building
--------

We use ArchISO to build our image. To install (as root):

	# make -C archiso install

You can then run the build script as root, passing it the location of a folder with at least 1700M of free space:

	# ./build.sh ~/scratch

Or you can manually copy this checkout to a temporary folder, chown it to root and:

	# cd configs/releng 
	# ./build.sh build single netinstall
