Jmeter Slave Live Distro v2.1 "Flame"
(based on Arch Linux Live ISO) (\l)
\s-\r \m.

Default logins "root" and "arch" have no password, but you cannot ssh in.

Non-privledged user "liveuser" with password "password" can ssh in.

Jmeter will be running within tmux, as liveuser use "tmux attach" to connect.

You should be able to browse for this machine using Avahi for _ssh._tcp and _jmeter._tcp

Happy performance testing!
